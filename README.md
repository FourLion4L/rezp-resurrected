# ReZombiePlague: Resurrected

## What is this?
ReZombiePlague: Resurrected is a fork of ReZombiePlague, which is the result of the development of a modification for the Counter-Strike game based on the original Zombie Plague modification using modern technologies and deeper integration over the game library.

## Goals of the original project
* Develop a modification architecture from scratch with the experience of previous years.
* Minimum dependencies between plugins.
* Extended API for plugins and minimum boilerplate code coverage.

## Goals of the fork
* While a C++ iteration of the modification (namely, [rezombie](https://github.com/fl0werD/rezombie)) is developing in its own pace, I'll try to fix all the known bugs of AMXXPawn version while also bringing new features and changes for the ease of use.
* Main branch contains new features and core changes of the modification, specific to this fork.
* Compatibility branch contains only bug fixes of the original ReZP and die-hard QoE updates.

## Requirements
ReHLDS, ReGameDLL, Metamod-r (or Metamod-P), AMX Mod X, ReAPI. **Use the latest versions to avoid unexpected behavior**.

## KNOWN BUGS
* Game modes stop working after the first round.
