# ReZombiePlague: Resurrected

## What is this?
ReZombiePlague: Resurrected is a fork of ReZombiePlague, which is the result of the development of a modification for the Counter-Strike game based on the original Zombie Plague modification using modern technologies and deeper integration over the game library. The aim of this fork is to fix the flaws of the original modification and also bring more features, such as thorough documentation, expanded customisation, etc.

## Goals of the project
* Develop a modification architecture from scratch with the experience of previous years.
* Develop a modification that works out of the box and has lots of expandable customizability.
* Have minimum dependencies between plugins.
* Extended API for plugins and minimum boilerplate code coverage.

## Features
‒ All the features of ReZombiePlague. This fork also inherits and expands upon its coding principles.
‒ Different gamemodes now happen after the first round of the game.
‒ Now you can immediately start any registered gamemode via Admin-Menu.

## WIKI (heavily WIP)
This repository has a Wiki! There you'll find API notes (duplicated from includes), minor API usage examples, building tutorial, explanations of how systems work, and other instructions. All of that for the sake of convenience and an easy start with ReZombiePlague: Resurrected!

## Requirements
ReHLDS, ReGameDLL, Metamod-r (or Metamod-P), AMX Mod X, ReAPI. **Use the latest versions in order to avoid unexpected behavior**.
